        "\n",
        "---> Abstraction in Java is a fundamental concept of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows you to hide the implementation details of an object and only expose the essential features or behaviors that are relevant to the user. Here are some of the advantages of abstraction in Java:\n",
        "\n",
        "Simplifies Complexity: Abstraction helps in managing the complexity of a program by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable units. It allows you to focus on the high-level design and functionality of objects rather than getting bogged down by their internal complexities.\n",
        "\n",
        "Encapsulation: Abstraction is closely related to encapsulation. By hiding the implementation details of an object, you can prevent direct access to its internal state from outside the object. This promotes data security and enhances maintainability.\n",
        "\n",
        "Code Reusability: Abstraction enables the creation of reusable components. Once you define an abstract class or interface, you can derive multiple concrete classes from it, each implementing the abstract methods in its own way. This promotes code reuse and avoids code duplication.\n",
        "\n",
        "Flexibility and Extensibility: Abstraction allows you to define the structure of a class or an interface without specifying its actual implementation. This provides flexibility to change or extend the implementation later without affecting the code that uses the abstracted class or interface.\n",
        "\n",
        "Loose Coupling: Abstraction helps in achieving loose coupling between classes and modules. When you interact with an object through its abstraction (e.g., an interface), you don't need to worry about the underlying implementation. This allows you to change the implementation of an object without affecting other parts of the code.\n",
        "\n",
        "Improves Maintainability: By abstracting away the implementation details, the code becomes easier to understand and maintain. Changes to the implementation can be localized to the concrete classes, while the interface remains unchanged.\n",
        "\n",
        "Promotes Modularity: Abstraction promotes the division of a large program into smaller, self-contained modules. Each module can be developed and tested independently, which makes the overall development process more manageable."
